# Biography

## Academic background

I completed my PhD in Physics at Rice University in Houston. I was advised by Professors [Andrew Long](http://al72.blogs.rice.edu/) and [Mustafa Amin](http://mustafa-amin.com/). My research consists of quantifying cosmological signatures of axion-like particles, looking for evidence of them in cosmological and astrophysical data. In particular, I focused on the prospect of detecting axion strings via the cosmic microwave background using an effect known as cosmic birefringence. A full list of [my publications can be found here](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=find%20a%20ray%20hagimoto), and a copy of [my thesis is available here](https://repository.rice.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/155c26de-4b32-4017-8e94-346935dd1f8f/content).


As an undergrad I did research in computational nanophotonics with [Nicolas Large](https://sites.google.com/site/acoustoplasmonics/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio and did NSF REUs at Brigham Young University and the University of Chicago where I studied quantum dynamics and cosmology respectively.

## Personal background

My parents are Japanese and Spanish/American. I grew up in Singapore and moved to the Texas for university, where I've lived ever since.

Outside of physics I enjoy origami, photography, and cooking!
